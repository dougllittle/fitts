### Widow Fix

Widow Fix is a jQuery plugin to fix widows, or orphans, or whatever you call themâ€”those single words on their own line. It does this by adding a &nbsp; (non-breaking space) in between the last 2 words.

Another related script is [Widow Tamer](https://github.com/nathanford/widowtamer) by Nathan Ford mentioned on http://artequalswork.com/posts/on-widows.php which is pretty sweet too.

Available in bower as `jquery-widowfix`
